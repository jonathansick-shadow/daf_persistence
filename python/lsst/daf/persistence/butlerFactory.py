"""This module defines the ButlerFactory class."""

from lsst.daf.persistence import Butler


class ButlerFactory(object):
    """ButlerFactory creates data Butlers containing data mappers.  Use of it
    is deprecated in favor of the direct Butler constructor.

    The ButlerFactory class takes a mapper for a data collection.
    It can then create Butlers with these mappers.

    A data identifier is a dictionary.  The keys match those understood by a
    mapper; the values select particular data sets or collections of data
    sets.  For example, one key might be "visit".  Specifying a value of
    "695934" for this key might select a collection of images.

    The mappers perform four functions:
      1. Determine what keys are valid for dataset ids.
      2. Obtain a collection of potential dataset ids matching a
         partial dataset id.
      3. Map a dataset id to the location of the dataset, including its
         C++ and Python types.
      4. Manipulate a retrieved dataset object so that it conforms to a
         standard.
