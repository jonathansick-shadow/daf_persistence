        Such a template would be suitable for generating a path given a set of
        fields in a dictionary.  Does not handle hex (%x or %X).

        Example:
            %(field)s/%(visit)d/%(exposure)d/raw-%(visit)d-e%(exposure)03d-c%(ccd)03d-a%(amp)03d.fits

        Note that fields may appear multiple times; the second and subsequent
        appearances of such fields will have "_{number}" appended to them to
        disambiguate, although it is typically assumed that they will all be
        identical.

        Trailing brackets (and their contents) can be used to indicate which HDU from a file should
        be used. They will not be included in the filename search.
